# Smart Energy Chain Smart Contract Platform


## Introduction to the Smart Energy Chain Platform
The Smart Energy Chain Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. The Smart Energy Chain Platform is an EVM compatible blockchain who solves the biggest problem of Dapp industry. The Smart Energy Chain Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Solving market's biggest problem
The blockchain industry's most significant application lies in decentralized applications (Dapps) functioning on various blockchains. However, the operational efficiency of these Dapps, particularly in high-demand sectors like gaming, metaverse, and NFTs, is critically hindered by the limited transaction speeds offered by conventional blockchain technology. This constraint often forces Dapps to contemplate abandoning blockchain in favor of centralized web applications to achieve their full operational potential.

Our blockchain solution directly addresses this issue by integrating a robust Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, enabling a high transaction per second (TPS) capacity. This enhancement not only accelerates transaction processing but also fortifies network security through a dedicated network of validators responsible for transaction verification. Such advancements in speed and security are instrumental in empowering Dapps to continue their innovative pursuits within the blockchain ecosystem without compromise.

Additionally, our blockchain technology addresses a prevalent financial challenge faced by Dapp developers: inadequate cash flow. Despite high user engagement and transaction volumes, Dapp developers often see little financial return, as transaction fees are traditionally accrued by miners or stakers in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. This dynamic exacerbates the financial disparity within the industry. Our innovative solution redistributes a portion of transaction fees to smart contract deployers, thereby generating a positive cash flow for Dapp developers. This strategic reallocation ensures a more equitable financial ecosystem, enabling developers to sustain their projects and continue their innovative contributions to the blockchain landscape..

## Declaration
To empower the decentralized applications (Dapps) ecosystem 

## Vision
Smart Energy Chain's vision is not only to be the best public blockchain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Smart Energy Chain is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Smart Energy Chain's Performance
- TPS: 100000
- Average block interval: "3s"

## Consensus Mechanism
DPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is SEP; the transactions consume SEP as gas fee.

Miners pledge SEP to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as ETH, BNB and stable coins can be mapped to Smart Energy Chain by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Smart Energy Chain. 

Smart Energy Chain encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Smart Energy Chain Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Support Plan of Smart Energy Chain
### Financial Support
- Smart Energy Chain will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- Smart Energy Chain will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on Smart Energy Chain Dapp, the Smart Energy Chain meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding SEP in a step-wise manner.

### Traffic Support
Smart Energy Chain will strongly support the development of Smart Energy Chain ecosystem:
- Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on Smart Energy Chain.
- After running successfully on Smart Energy Chain, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to Smart Energy Chain trading platform, and can be listed on it if they meet the listing standards.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from Smart Energy Chain have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in Smart Energy Chain foundation roadshows for free.
- Smart Energy Chain will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.
